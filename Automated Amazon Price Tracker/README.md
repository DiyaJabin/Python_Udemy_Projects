\# Automated Price Tracker



This project was built as part of a Udemy Python course.



It demonstrates:

\- sending HTTP requests

\- parsing HTML using BeautifulSoup

\- extracting and cleaning price data

\- using environment variables for email credentials

\- sending an email alert when a target price is reached



A demo webpage provided by the course is used instead of a real Amazon page,

as real product pages block automated scraping.



This project is for learning purposes only.
